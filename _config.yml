title: Tracking and deleting an object using the SiamMask and inpainting methods. The analysis and comparison
description: The amount of video data is growing rapidly and constantly, as well as it`s importance and significance. 
In this regard, there are also new tasks for the intellectual processing of this data. 
One of the basic and at the same time urgent tasks in this area is to create easy - to-use tools for video processing â€“ video editors.
A popular component of such systems is a tool for removing unnecessary objects from the video sequence. 
In this work, deleting an object from a video is considered as a two-stage process.
The first step is to localize the object on all frames of the video. The second option is deletion (inpainting).
